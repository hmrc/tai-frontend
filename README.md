This service Allows users to view and edit their paye tax information

Summary
-----------
This service covers the current tax year. Use the service to:
 * check your tax code and Personal Allowance
 * tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) about changes that affect your tax code
 * update your employer or pension provider details
 * see an estimate of how much tax you’ll pay over the whole tax year
 * check and change the estimates of how much income you’ll get from your jobs, pensions or bank and building society savings interest


Requirements
------------

This service is written in [Scala 2.11](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play 2.5](http://playframework.com/), so needs at least a [JRE 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) to run. In addition to Scala and JRE dependencies, the service also depends on [node.js 4.8.4](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm 2.15.11](https://www.npmjs.com/).

How to install node on Ubuntu
-----------------------------
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs

< check whether npm came along >

npm -version

..if it isn't there ..


sudo apt-get install npm

also

sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
..which will give you an alias of 'node' instead of 'nodejs'

THEN

sudo npm install -g n

(will install the 'n' utility - allowing switching of node versions)


sudo n 4.8.4

..which will install the version of node we need for TAI-FRONTEND

Authentication
------------
